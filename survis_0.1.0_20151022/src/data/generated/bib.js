Despite these challenges, few mental health interventions have been developed to support YLWH. Previous randomized results from the Sauti ya Vijana (SYV; \u201cThe Voice of Youth\u201d) mental health intervention were indicative of the intervention\u2019s bene\ufb01ts in promoting virologic suppression. Methods: SYV is a group-based mental health and life skills intervention (pilot, individually randomized group treatment trial) developed alongside YLWH. SYV was comprised of 10, 90-minute sessions based on evidence-based treatment models designed to improve coping, social support, and hope for future as a pathway to improved adherence and virologic suppression. At baseline, YLWH 12 to 24 years of age were randomized to SYV or standard of care. Participants included in this secondary analysis were enrolled in SYV\u2019s crossover waves due to either being randomized to standard of care or inability to attend an earlier group, and therefore delayed intervention exposure. Measured outcomes included self-reported mental health measures, self-reported human immunode\ufb01ciency virus measures (stigma and adherence), and human immunode\ufb01ciency virus ribonucleic acid. Data was collected at baseline, preintervention, and postintervention timepoints. Participants were included if they attended a crossover wave and had data at all 3 timepoints. Results: Twenty-one crossover participants met inclusion criteria. Mean scores of self-reported mental health questionnaires were in an asymptomatic range both pre- and postintervention. Viral suppression was N",
